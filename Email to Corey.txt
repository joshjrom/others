Hello Corey,

My name is Joshua and I'm a subscriber to your YouTube channel with username - Josh Greg.  I recently started following your OOP tutorial video on python and decided to try it out myself. I created some instance variables which work fine, but some I created do not work. Employee email and salary raise methods do not show up when printed.

Please could take some time to look into it? My code  and screenshot are shown below:

class Employee():

    def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, email, salary):
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName
        self.email = email
        self.salary = salary

    def fullName(self):
        return "{} {}".format(self.firstName, self.lastName)

    def employeeEmail(self):
        return self.email

    def salary(self):
        return self.salary

    def salaryRaise(self):
        self.salary = int(self.salary + 5000)
        return self.salary


employee1 = Employee("Joshua", "Ayegba", "ayegbjoshua@yahoo.com", 5000)


print(employee1.salary)
print(employee1.employeeEmail)
print(employee1.salaryRaise)
